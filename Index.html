                    HTML, short for Hyper Text Markup Language, 
                    is employed for crafting web pages through a 
                    markup system. HTML merges the concepts of 
                    Hypertext and Markup language, with Hypertext 
                    dictating the connections among web pages.

                    Cascading Style Sheets, affectionately known as CSS, 
                    is a straightforward language created to make the task 
                    of beautifying web pages easier. CSS enables you to 
                    add visual styles to web pages.

                    PHP stands for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor, 
                    a server-side scripting language crafted 
                    explicitly for web development. It can be 
                    seamlessly integrated into HTML files, 
                    making it a powerful tool for web developers.

                    JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995. 
                    Initially, it went by the name LiveScript but was 
                    eventually renamed JavaScript. JavaScript is like 
                    the powerhouse of web development, providing the 
                    muscle behind the structure of websites.
